# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis on Uber Dataset

In this project, I focuses on performing a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Uber ride dataset to uncover key insights, trends, and patterns that can inform better business and operational decisions.

## Objective

The primary objective of the project is to:

* Understand the distribution and trends in Uber ride requests
* Analyze ride demand over time
* Identify patterns in pickup locations and times
* Suggest improvements for ride availability and service efficiency

## Dataset

The dataset contains Uber ride details with the following columns:

| Column       | Description                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `START_DATE` | Date and time the ride began                                |
| `END_DATE`   | Date and time the ride ended                                |
| `CATEGORY`   | Type of ride â€“ *Business* or *Personal*                     |

| `STOP`       | Destination city or location                                |
| `MILES`      | Distance traveled (in miles)                                |
| `PURPOSE`    | Purpose of the trip (e.g., Meeting, Errand, Customer Visit) |

## Insights & Observations

* Peak demand occurs during **evening hours (5â€“8 PM)** on **weekdays**
* Higher ride volumes were seen on **Fridays and Saturdays**
* Clusters of high pickup activity in central NYC zones
* Weekends show increased activity during late hours

## Recommendations

* Increase driver availability during peak hours and weekends
* Focus marketing strategies around high-demand zones
* Monitor weather and events for surge predictions
